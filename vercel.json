// This file is used to redirect the root path to a specific destination.
// The redirect is permanent, meaning it will be cached by browsers and search engines.
// The destination is set to "https://bombinhas.online/smartclick".
// The source path is set to "/", which means any request to the root of the domain will be redirected.
// This configuration is typically used in Vercel deployments to manage URL redirection.
// The "redirects" array can contain multiple redirect rules, allowing for flexible routing.
// The "source" field specifies the path to match, and the "destination" field specifies where to redirect.
// The "permanent" field indicates that this is a permanent redirect (HTTP status code 301).
// This file should be placed in the root of your Vercel project.
// Make sure to test the redirect after deployment to ensure it works as expected.
// Note: If you need to add more redirects, you can simply append more objects to the "redirects" array.
